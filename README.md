# RPG Console Game

## Description
This is a complex console game set on a 10x10 grid where players control characters from three different races: Warrior, Mage, and Archer. Monsters, represented by â—™, spawn randomly on the grid every turn. Health and mana are displayed above the grid.

## Rules
Before embarking on your journey, you can customize your preferred character. You can allocate up to 3 additional points to boost your character's stats. Then you have two choices each turn:

### Move
Players navigate the grid using the following keys:  
`W, A, S, D, E, X, Q, Z`  

- Moving beyond the grid boundaries or onto a space occupied by a monster will skip your turn.  
- Be careful, because monsters are coming for you!

### Attack
- Selecting the attack option displays a list of monsters within your range, along with their current health.  
- Choose which monster to attack strategically.
